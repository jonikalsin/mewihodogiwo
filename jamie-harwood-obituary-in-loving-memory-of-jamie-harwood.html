According to Harwood, Robert Moore was located on Sunday just a few minutes before noon. Moore was reportedly homeless at the time. An autopsy was performed to try to discover what caused Moore’s death, but the results were inconclusive.</p><p>According to Harwood, “It did demonstrate some medical issues that you would probably expect out of most people who are 75 years old, and that is to have some sort of clinical disease, which is kind of what we discovered.” However, we were unable to identify any serious issues that could have led to his passing. The results of a toxicological test are not yet available, but there are no indications that any foul play was involved.</p><p>The office of the coroner was inundated with offers to cover the costs of Moore’s funeral from people all around the world via social media. Harwood reported that the staff had also been successful in locating one of Moore’s cousins. Harwood added, “But he [Moore] did have resources available that we can take care of his cremation and burial,” “As a result, we will handle that situation for him.” Moore was apparently a well-known character in the region and enjoyed a positive reputation among members of the Campustown business community, according to the accounts of some employees of businesses located there.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwtsCmoJ5lmJa%2FuLvOnWSompmpwqK%2B2Gagp2WcpMOqusZmpJ6ln6fGbrvFZqGapZmaeqmt0bCmqJxf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
