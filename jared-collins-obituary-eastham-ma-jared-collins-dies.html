At the tender age of 5, he accepted Christ as his savior, and he remained Baptist by faith throughout his journey. His faith was a source of strength and comfort, providing guidance and solace during both life’s challenges and its joyful moments.&nbsp;Jared is preceded in death by his paternal grandfather, Albert J. Collins, Sr., and his maternal grandparents, Milon A. & Myrtle L. Gay. He is survived by his loving parents, Albert Jarahn Collins, Jr. & Kim G. Collins of Lyons, who shared in his joys and provided unwavering support throughout his life. His sister and brother-in-law, Kayla C. & Jake Dyal of Lyons, were part of a musical journey that enriched their lives and the lives of those who heard them.</p><p>Jared also leaves behind his two nephews, Jasper & Jacus Dyal, the younger generation touched by his love and music. His paternal grandmother, June Collins of Lyons, stands as a testament to the enduring bonds of family. She will undoubtedly hold dear the cherished memories of her grandson.&nbsp;In the midst of his life’s journey, Jared found love in the arms of his girlfriend, Rachel Carter. Their bond was strengthened through the shared experience of life’s ups and downs. Rachel’s sons, Jayden & Brantley, became an integral part of Jared’s life, adding further depth to his role as a loving and caring partner.</p><p>Jared is survived by numerous aunts, uncles, and cousins, all of whom will forever cherish the moments and memories they shared with him. These connections, both familial and extended, bear witness to the love and impact he had on all who knew him.&nbsp;The pallbearers who will accompany Jared on his final journey are Logan Lollis, Brock Aldrich, Chuck Hill, Nick Hayes, Nick Wilkerson, Ryan Collins, Lee Milligan, and Danny Lindsey. These friends and loved ones will provide the strength and support needed during this difficult time.</p><p>The memory of Jared, affectionately known as “Big Country,” will forever resonate in the hearts of those who knew and loved him. It is through the celebration of his life and the coming together of family and friends that we find solace in the face of loss. As we gather to pay our final respects and bid our goodbyes, we are reminded that the impact of a loved one’s life extends far beyond their physical presence. Jared’s spirit, music, and love will forever echo in our hearts, a reminder of the beautiful soul we had the privilege of knowing.&nbsp;In this moment of reflection and remembrance, we celebrate the life of Albert Jared Collins, a young man whose journey touched the lives of many, and whose legacy will endure in the hearts of those who were fortunate enough to share in his joys and sorrows.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwtsCrnJ1lk6S5rbXNrGSompmpwqK%2B2Gacmqukna6uecyaZKOZopqxbq%2FOpaOipqNisaqx0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
