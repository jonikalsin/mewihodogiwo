Issa Pointer, now 40-year-old, grew up surrounded by pure talent and she carries the passion for music on her DNA.</p><p class=Fg>She got her first taste for music whilst traveling with mother on their 1985 tour. Issa replaced her aunt, June Pointer, in 2002 after she left the group due to drug problems. Later on, June became sick and tragically died of lung cancer in 2004.</p><p class=Fg>The current Pointer Sisters lineup alternates between Ruth, her sister Anita, Issa, and Ruth's grandchild, Sadako. The group certainly continues to keep it in the family.</p><p class=Fg>According to her <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.issapointermusic.com/biography/>website</a>, Issa is not only a super talented singer but also an incredibly smart woman. She graduated from the Lycée Francais of L.A, so she speaks French. She has also performed with artists such as Earth Wind and Fire, Kathy Sledge of Sister Sledge, Gloria Gaynor, Chaka Kahn, and Grace Jones.</p><p class=Fg>Sadly, Dennis last February due to complications from meningitis, according to declarations of his last wife, Brenda Edwards. He was 74.</p><p class=Fg>Issa Pointer is blessed with a beautiful voice and has certainly inherited her parents' talent, as can be judged from the video below:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpnaWhna3qtscCdZKyhnpyys3nToZxmrJWivbWt06Kmp6tdmbKvusisZJ6cp5a%2Fb7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
