I have never drunk more water in my life.</p><p>“I don’t see the criticism for other people when they lost weight for roles — they are [considered] geniuses for their craft.”</p><p>The Hulu star added: “There are so many things out there that are so not accurate and not true.”</p><p>Back in May, Kim revealed the measures she took to drop so much weight.</p><p>The mother-of-four told&nbsp;Vogue&nbsp;at the Met Gala: “I tried [the dress] on and it didn’t fit me. I said, ‘Give me three weeks.’</p><h2>WEIGHT LOSS</h2><p>“I had to lose 16 pounds down today. It was such a challenge. It was like a [movie] role. I was determined to fit [into] it. I haven’t had carbs or sugar in about three weeks.”</p><p>And late last month, Kim admitted she has lost even more weight after sticking to the ultra-strict diet.</p><p>She said on&nbsp;The TODAY show: “It actually taught me a lot about my lifestyle and my health, and since then, afterwards, I continued to eat really healthy.</p><p>“I mean, I’m down 21 pounds now. I’m not trying to lose any more weight, but I have more energy than ever.”</p><h2>FEARS FOR KIM</h2><p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;The Sun&nbsp;exclusively revealed that Kim’s family is&nbsp;concerned she’s losing too much weight&nbsp;and is “barely sleeping”.</p><p>She has admitted her packed schedule of filming the family’s reality show, studying to become a lawyer, looking after her four children and her bi-coastal romance with&nbsp;Saturday Night Live&nbsp;star&nbsp;Pete Davidson&nbsp;has taken its toll.</p><p>“Kim looks amazing, always, but she’s good at keeping how stressed she is hidden,” an insider tells&nbsp;The Sun.&nbsp;</p><p>“She’s the skinniest she’s ever been and barely sleeping. Her family knows that a lot of this is her rebounding from a very controlling marriage, and her determination to show Kanye how much better she is doing without him.</p><img decoding=async alt="Whoopi subconsciously reveals 'true feelings about co-hosts', expert says" width=295 height=188 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/JF-US-WHOOPI-SURPRISE-EXC-COMP.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img decoding=async alt="Huge update in deaths of couple who vanished before bodies found in woods" width=295 height=188 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/BN-HIKING-COUPLE-COMP.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“But whereas before she was incredibly healthy and well-rested, now she’s constantly jetlagged and she’s finding it hard to fit workouts in.
