Haddish divorced William Stewart in 2013, and the former allegedly gave Jane a spot in her commercial.&nbsp;Jane and her family were completely uninformed of the incident, but Haddish and Spears were well aware of it. Furthermore, Haddish allegedly had to teach Jane how to imitate f****tio for a play about youngsters bickering over a sub sandwich. In an interview with The Daily Beast, Jane stated:</p><p>“I attempted to emulate what they wanted, but it simply turned out really unpleasant.” When I exited the booth, I realized I hadn’t finished what they had asked of me.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Tiffany-Haddish-1.jpg alt="Tiffany Haddish" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Jane was paid $100 and said that she did not tell her mother anything about what occurred during the filming. Haddish then contacted the brothers’ mother and informed her that she was interested in hiring her son John for a Nickelodeon sizzle reel. According to the complaint, Haddish and Spears assaulted John while shooting, and a video of the incident was shared on Funny Or Die and other sites.</p><p>A spokesman for Funny Or Die said that they would never disseminate such stuff and were not engaged in any way with the video.
