Grass types probably have the potential for a long life, but don't necessarily always have one</p><p>Egg groups can probably also be a helpful guidelines, like most things in the Dragon egg group probably have a very long lifespan, or the pokémon in the human-like egg group might have a relatively long lifespan (maybe not as long as a humans, but maybe at least half of it?)</p><p>I also think evolution might be able to prolong a pokémon's lifespan</p><p>and obviously Legendaries are excluded from this, not because I think they're all immortal, but because I think most of them have at least a pretty long lifespan, even if they don't have a typing that would support that (Ho-oh for example, which is Fire/Flying, two elements I think don't necessarily guarantee a long lifespan, but also based on the phoenix, which is reborn from its ash and all)</p><p>As for Vivillion's question, I guess pokémon like that could do either? Like, I imagine that it will show the wear and tear of old age at some point, but not randomly fall apart. They probably decompose differently a well (maybe certain Steel types just rust away?)</p><p>Oh and lastly, yes I think Ghost pokémon can die, as I don't think they're dead pokémon/people, as much as their beings with traits we attribute to ghosts (levitating, disappearing, lack of physical body) So I guess that when their time has come, they slowly cease to exist and disperse into nothingness? (though I think Ghost types generally get really old, so it doesn't happen that often/quickly)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHyxu8qepKimXaG2p7HSqZinZmFrhnWAkGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
