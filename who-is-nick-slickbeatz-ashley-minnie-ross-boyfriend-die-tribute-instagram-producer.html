Turns out Juicy was right about it as Minnie decided that she needed to set the record straight with Minnie and on an episode of their show, she took her to the side and revealed, “I just wanted to clear everything and tell you just up front, I wasn’t pregnant.”</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=#>How did Ashley 'Minnie' Ross die? The tragedy of car crash that took 'Little Women: Atlanta' star's life haunts fans</a></p><p><a href=# rel>What is Ms Juicy's net worth? Meet the ‘Little Women: Atlanta’ star who has ‘zero tolerance for bulls**t’</a></p><h2 class=split>Is Ashley dating someone?</h2><p>In the upcoming episode of 'LWATL' that airs on Friday, February 5, night, it is revealed that Minnie had indeed found a boyfriend. She was in a perfect relationship and didn't find the need to seek validation elsewhere. That was one of the reasons why none of the girls except for her clients and best friends Andrea and Amanda Salinas (Tiny Twinz) knew about it.</p><p>Minnie made the revelation in front of Juicy, the Tiny Twinz and Monie Cashette, and everyone was truly excited for their friend/sister. "I need to make sure he ain't married," Juicy said tongue in cheek and Minnie confirmed that he was single, African-American and that they had been together for a year.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Who is Ashley's boyfriend Nick aka Slickbeatz?</h2><p>Nick was introduced in the episode as Slickbeatz. During a meeting with Minnie's group, he revealed that he was a music producer. Minnie had also revealed that she was the first little person that Nick ever dated. At one point in the episode, the two are also seen out on a celebratory lunch and talk about how far they've come in just a year of dating each other.</p><p>They also spoke about how they met for the first time. "What did you think of me when you first saw me?" Minnie asked being all shy. "Look at the little woman," Nick answered without skipping a beat.&nbsp;</p><p>Minnie played very hard to get initially because as a little person, she had her guard up and wanted to know if he was really pursuing her or just wanted to be with a little person. "I'm like he's consistent," she said revealing why she finally gave him a chance.</p><h2 class=split>Was Ashley married to Nick?</h2><p>"My mother loves her," Nick said to Minnie's friends when Andrea asked about what his family thought about him dating a little person. Whether they were married or not is yet to be determined, however, in a preview for the next episode, Minnie took Nick to meet her mom who immediately spots a band on her daughter's finger and questions the reason behind it.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Nick calls her 'love of my life'</h2><p>According to PEOPLE,&nbsp;Ross' management team confirmed her death on April 27, one day after the 34-year-old 'Little Women: Atlanta star was involved in an accident on Old National Hwy in Georgia. Though her team initially believed she had been injured in a hit-and-run, a preliminary police investigation found that Ross' car struck another vehicle head-on and that no third vehicle was involved.</p><p>After Minnie's death, The Shade Room reported on Instagram that the Atlanta-based music producer posted a photo of the two on his page where he called Minnie, “love of my life.”</p><p>His post read, “The moment I saw you, I just knew it. I realized that you are all that I have been searching for all my life. I love you today, I love you tomorrow, and I will love you the same 10 years from now. Ima miss you baby girl #teamminnieforlife" alongside a photo of him kissing Minnie on the side of her cheek.&nbsp;</p><p>Catch all-new episodes of 'Little Women: Atlanta' every Friday night at 10 pm ET on Lifetime.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjKegnKNdqLmqr8qbnJqsqmKutLTLnrBmpZmju6qxjKumrKtdl7y6stGinKecXZm2pnnTq6CbraSaeqq60q2YoKqRonqxvs6drJydog%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
