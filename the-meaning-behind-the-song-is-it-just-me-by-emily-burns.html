She describes sitting alone, picking at the sofa in an attempt to distract herself from the fact that she misses her former partner. There is also a hint of jealousy in the lines, wondering if her ex’s friends have had to take care of him after a night of partying. It’s a relatable sentiment, as many of us have experienced that mix of longing and bitterness after a breakup.</p><p>The pre-chorus takes a darker turn, as Burns admits to a somewhat cruel desire for her ex to also feel the pain she is going through. It’s a conflicting emotion, but one that perfectly captures the messy emotions that often arise after a breakup.</p><p>The chorus of the song is where the title, “Is It Just Me?”, comes in. Burns questions whether her ex feels the same heartache that she does when they hear her name mentioned at a party, or if it’s just her who is hurting. She wonders if he is also tongue-tied and screaming on the inside when people ask why they broke up. It’s a powerful moment in the song that highlights the vulnerability and insecurity we often feel after a breakup.</p><p>The second verse delves further into Burns’ thoughts about her ex moving on. She hears rumors that he is spending time with a blonde girl from work, and her mind starts to imagine all the worst-case scenarios. She wonders if he is sitting alone, repeatedly dialing her number, or if he is seeking comfort from others. The verse captures the anxiety and obsession that can consume us when we are still attached to someone who has moved on.</p><p>The bridge of the song brings a moment of introspection. Burns acknowledges that it would be easier if she knew that her ex was also struggling, as it would validate her own pain. It’s a moment of self-awareness and vulnerability, showing that she is not just pointing fingers but also reflecting on her own emotions.</p><p>The final chorus repeats the earlier questions, emphasizing the emotional turmoil Burns is experiencing. The addition of the line “Are you crying in the shower like a freak?” adds a touch of self-deprecating humor, highlighting the absurdity of some of the ways we cope with heartbreak.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Personal_Connection></span>A Personal Connection<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>I remember stumbling upon this song at a friend’s house, and it immediately struck a chord with me. At the time, I was going through my own breakup, and “Is It Just Me?” perfectly encapsulated the rollercoaster of emotions I was experiencing. Listening to the song felt like having a conversation with a friend who understood exactly what I was going through.</p><p>One of the things I appreciate most about Emily Burns’ music is her ability to convey raw vulnerability in her lyrics. She has a talent for capturing the messiness of love and heartbreak, and her honesty resonates deeply with listeners. “Is It Just Me?” is a testament to this, as it speaks to the universal feelings of longing, insecurity, and confusion that many of us have experienced in our own relationships.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Closer_Look_at_the_Album></span>A Closer Look at the Album<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>“Is It Just Me?” is featured on Emily Burns’ debut studio album, “My Town,” released in 2019.
