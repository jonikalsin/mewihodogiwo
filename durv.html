Durv is famous for prank calls, bottle flip contest videos in addition to Q&As, and challenge videos.</span></h3><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Childhood>Early Life and Childhood</span></h2><p>Durv’s age is <strong>21 years old</strong> as of 2024. He was born on <strong>14 </strong><strong>March 2003</strong>, in his birthplace, Crawley, England. His birth name is Dylan Adam McEvoy and his birth sign is Pisces. Therefore, there is no information regarding his parents and siblings.</p><p>Likewise, he belongs to British nationality but has not mentioned his ethnic background. Moving toward his educational background, he might have completed his high school graduation at his age. However, he has not mentioned his school’s name.</p><h2><span id=Professional_life>Professional life</span></h2><p>Talking about his professional life, he started his YouTube channel in 2016 under the name ‘ItzDurv’. The first debut video he featured is titled ‘Shoutout Sunday #1- Grow Your Channel! Gain Active Subscribers!’. He came into the limelight after his video titled ‘My school is deleting my channel.’ In this video, he explained why his school professionals were against his channel and how they approached him to bring the channel down.</p><p>That video of him became successful in gaining over 6 million views before his channel’s termination. After that, he posted much more controversial titled videos like ‘My teacher has a crush on me, ‘YOUTUBE sent me the wrong play button’, and ‘I am dropping school at the age of 13’.</p><p>Likewise, he repeatedly gained the limelight when he uploaded a video titled ‘Wanna join my gift card giveaway’. In the video, he offered a giveaway in which he pretended to give his subscribers XBOX Live gift cards. After this video was uploaded on his channel, a person among his followers (name unknown) exposed the YouTuber. The man noticed that the XBOX Live gift card design was of an old gift card and then went on to reveal other card designs that were fake as well.</p><p>However, he is not active currently on YouTube and has an Instagram handle where he has gained a few fan followers. He posts his daily lifestyle updates over there. His YouTube account got seized.</p><h4><span>Scandals</span></h4><p>Being involved in a social media career, it’s quite hard to escape from controversies. However, he has let himself into scandalous and controversial acts that have disturbed his personal as well as professional life. He has been heavily punished for using clickbait to earn views and subscribers.</p><p>In September 2017, the Young YouTuber released an official diss track titled “Commentaries End” where he yelled out Pyrocynical, LeafyIsHere, Memeulous, ImAllexx, and WillNE. However, this video gained several views before it was deleted.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-26443 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Durv-scandal.jpg alt=Durv width=650 height=361 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-26443 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Durv on his scandalous clickbait video (Source: YouTube)</p><p>Furthermore, he mentioned several other points which ultimately proved the YouTuber guilty.

He has not been able to win back the love of his lost supporters. Several people hate him and his comment section normally includes negative comments. Also, his videos consist of the number of dislikes rather than the number of likes.
