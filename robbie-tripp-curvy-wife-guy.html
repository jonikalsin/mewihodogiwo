TEAM TRIPP: THE NEXT GENERATION!!!!! 👶🏻🌵🤑🏀👜👠💋 It fills me with pure joy to announce that @sassyredlipstick is now a sacred vessel carrying my seed, the heir to the Tripp name, creating life in her beautiful, soft, increasingly round tummy. 😍🤗 We’ve been keeping this exciting secret for a couple months and now are so pleased to be able to share with you this next chapter in our story! Each day we get more excited to meet little Tripp/little Sassy. I’ve already bought so many children’s books to inspire our little one to be a positive and creative dream chaser, and I can’t wait to tell him/her stories every night to encourage his/her imagination. 💡 Update: Sarah has been a pure fertile goddess these past 15 weeks and I’m just here to worship and support her as she grows the future leader of nations in her five-star womb. I like to kneel down and talk to Baby Tripp through Sarah’s belly button and I often remind our child that he/she is very lucky to have such a beautiful and elegant mother to grow inside of. We are so blessed to have this miracle in our lives, and we’ve already devoted our whole heart to Baby Tripp. Can’t wait for Team Tripp to receive its third, tiniest member. 💛 Thank you to each and every one of you who has shown us love today. The outpouring of support has been so incredibly heartwarming. We appreciate all of you, whether you’re a newcomer or have been following along for each chapter of our journey. All love. 🙌🏼 #TeamTripp #DesertDad</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=#>ROBBIE TRIPP™</a> (@tripp) on Apr 21, 2019 at 7:24pm PDT</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Race</strong> / <strong>Ethnicity</strong></h3><p>White</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Hair Color</strong></h3><p>Brunette</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Eye Color</strong></h3><p>Blue</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Robbie Tripp ‘Curvy Wife Guy’ Net Worth</strong></h3><p>“Curvy Wife Guy” Robbie Tripp has an estimated <strong>net worth </strong>of $700 thousand dollars.
