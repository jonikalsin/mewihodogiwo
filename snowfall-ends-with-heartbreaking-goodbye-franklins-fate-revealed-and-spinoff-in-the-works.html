The dramatic irony of Franklin having to live in poverty in the neighborhood he had destroyed felt like the right choice for the show’s creators.</p><p>“Snowfall” was co-created by John Singleton, who passed away in 2019, making it his final project. The show has been praised for shedding light on the impact of the crack epidemic on Black communities in the United States during the 1980s.</p><p>A spinoff of the show is reportedly in early development, with Wanda, a character introduced in the final season, rumored to be the link between the original series and the spinoff.
