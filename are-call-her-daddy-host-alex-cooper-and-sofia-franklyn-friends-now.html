Not only that, but fans want to know if they are still friends.</span></p><p><span>When she appeared on an episode of The Morning Toast in February 2022, the former Call Her Daddy co-host addressed all of those questions. </span><span>She hinted that the former coworkers and best friends are unlikely to rekindle their friendship.</span></p><p><span>During the chat, Franklyn even quipped that she might rethink working with Cooper if the current Call Her Daddy host offered her $30 million. She was referring to Cooper’s $60 million deal with Spotify, which is set to begin in 2021.</span></p><p><span>“It was also difficult to watch something you’d worked on for so [expletive] long being sold for that kind of money,”</span></p><p><span>Franklyn remarked on the Spotify/Call Her Daddy agreement. </span><span>She went on to say,</span></p><p><span>“I genuinely think if I had continued on the program and we hadn’t deceived each other… I honestly believe we could have sold it for more money, which was always our intention.”</span></p><p><span>To cut to the chase, Franklyn’s statements make it clear that she and Cooper are not friends, and they have no plans to reconcile.</span></p><h2><span>Sofia Franklyn Launches Her Own Podcast</span></h2><p><span>While Cooper kept hosting the Call Her Daddy podcast, Franklyn launched her own, Sofia With an F.</span></p><p><span>In addition to where she is now in her work, the internet star told The Morning Toast presenter Claudia Oshry that she was in a “90 percent better place.”</span></p><p><span>Franklyn also added that she would be lying if she said she was completely back to who she was when she worked at Call Her Daddy.</span></p><p><span>Cooper, on the other hand, appears to be doing exceptionally well with the long-running show. Her most recent episode, starring former adult actress Julia Fox, is also doing incredibly well.</span></p><p><span>During the conversation, Fox revealed her experiences in the adult industry as well as her thoughts on her boyfriend Kanye West, who is still in love with his separated wife, Kim Kardashian.</span></p><p><span>“It’s been a wild few weeks for the show these last few weeks. “</span></p><p><span>Thank you to the Daddy Gang for always believing in me and giving the episodes a chance before passing judgment,</span></p><p><span>” Cooper tweeted after the interview was praised.”</span></p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYq51dmK6tuIyhnKtllJaxpcWMoaasrF2WuabEjJymqKiVp3qiusNmqqiemZZ6p77Ap6KlsZ5is7O1xKebrGWepMRw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
