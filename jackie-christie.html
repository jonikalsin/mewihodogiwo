She was one of the two main characters on the show, the other being Draya Michele.</p><p>Jackie first appeared on the show as a guest in the second season, but she became a regular in season six. She was always involved in controversies on the show and was described as dominant and harsh by many of her co-stars, who even requested her removal from the series on several occasions.</p><p>Not only that, but many accused her of being a pathological liar, but Jackie remained the most visible of the show’s ladies. She also wrote six self-help/motivational books, including “Sexual Relations,” “No Ordinary Love,” “Woman,” “Proud to be a Colored Girl,” “Luv Pons,” and “In the Land of Sex & Money.”</p><p>She is the founder and CEO of Jean Fya Records, an independent record label, as well as the owner of BSM media, a lifestyle and entertainment company. In addition, in 2009, she launched her clothing line ‘Colored Girl,’ which is unique in that it is eco-friendly and organic.</p><p>This demonstrates that she has been extremely busy outside of the show and has made a name for herself in the entertainment industry. Since the early 2000s, her publishing company, ‘Infinite Love Publishing,’ which she co-owns with her husband, has had an NPO registered under it called ‘Infinite Love Foundation,’ which has been helping society in its various needs on a monthly basis.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
