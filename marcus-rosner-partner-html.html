Here is everything we know about Rosner and his wife.&nbsp;</p><h2>Marcus Rosner's History with His Partner</h2><p>It is reported that Rosner's wife is Alison Kroeker, who goes by @ali.kroeker on Instagram. She is currently in California, where she works as a documentary producer and writer.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Marcus Rosner's first picture with his partner, Ali Kroeker. </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>It is unknown when Rosner and Kroeker first started dating. However, it is speculated that the pair got together around 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>This is because the actor first posted a picture with his partner on August 30, 2017. He has hidden their faces with animal emojis, but they are dressed formally in front of a lake.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Rosner captioned the picture as "I get those goosebumps everytime..." with a music emoji. Since then, he has often posted about or with his spouse.&nbsp;</p><p>However, he either does not show her face or hides it with emojis every time he does so. After dating for a couple of years, the Arrow actor proposed to Kroeker on December 31, 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>He made the announcement the following day, on January 1, 2021.&nbsp;He uploaded a grayscale picture of his and Kroeker's hands,&nbsp;where the latter showed off her engagement ring.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Marcus Rosner&nbsp;and Ali Kroker showing off her&nbsp;engagement ring.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>Rosner captioned the photo as "In the midst of a life well-lived. #aboutlastnight&nbsp;#nye2020." He also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">organized</a> a massive engagement party for Kroeker in&nbsp;Edmonton, Alberta.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He thanked his "good friends" for helping him "pull off something very special for someone who was willing to wait a long time."</p><p>Then, on January 3, 2021, he posted <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">another picture</a> where he was on his knees, holding a ring box.&nbsp;</p><h2>Marcus Rosner's Wedding Ceremony&nbsp;</h2><p>Soon after, the two were planning a wedding to get married. Then, in June 2021, they went to Guatemala for a vacation.&nbsp;</p><p>However, while they enjoyed their time there, the pair also planned their wedding. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Rosner <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> he and his partner&nbsp;planned to get married on New Year's Eve, exactly a year after their engagement.</p><p>Exactly as they planned, the duo got married on New Year's Eve on December 31, 2021. They had a beautiful ceremony surrounded by their friends and family at Guatemala's Convento De Monjas Santa Clara.&nbsp;</p><p>The pair planned their ceremony alongside I Do, Guatemala, and Auguro Weddings. The latter&nbsp;dubbed the ceremony&nbsp;as "last wedding of the Year!"&nbsp;</p><p>Rosner shared pictures of their wedding ceremony on his social media. His family and his wife also did a very stunning <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">photoshoot</a> after the ceremony at&nbsp;Convento La Recolección.&nbsp;</p><p>All in all, they had a fabulous ceremony, and the pair are currently living the best of their married life.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKWRp7C2v4yrpqymlad6sa3RraWeql6dwa64</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
