He boasts of his wealth, street credibility, and his status among his peers, referencing his "top-shelf" position in the rap game. Through some wordplay, he also references some of his other hit songs, such as "Go DJ" and "A Milli." The chorus of the song is a clever play on words, with Lil Wayne making the analogy between his car's paint job and the popular type of ice cream that is often decorated with a variety of colorful sprinkles.</p><br><p>Throughout the song, Lil Wayne makes several references to guns and violence, rapping about his experience and willingness to use them if necessary. He also boasts about his sexual prowess and the number of women he has access to. The lyrics are delivered with the rapper's trademark flow and energy, making for an entertaining listen.<br></p><p><span class=lyrics-text>Contributed by Levi K.
