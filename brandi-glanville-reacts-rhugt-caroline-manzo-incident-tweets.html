The outlet claimed that Brandi allegedly gave her co-star “unwanted kisses” which led to both of the TV stars departing from the show early. The insider told the outlet at the time that Brandi allegedly “touched [Manzo’s] breast area and vaginal area” while they were filming in Morocco on Jan. 25. In addition, the source also alleged that the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Drinking And Tweeting author</a>, “stuck her tongue down [Manzo’s] throat.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Although the incident has not officially been confirmed, the production company behind <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the show</a>, Shed, and Peacock released a statement to Page Six at the time about the matter. “The safety and security of cast and crew while shooting is extremely important and we take all reports seriously. In this situation, production immediately launched a comprehensive review and is taking appropriate action,” the joint statement read. The outlet also reported that Caroline left Morocco on Jan. 27, about two days after the alleged incident.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Brandi-Glanville-rhugt-caroline-manzo-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Prior to&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a>&nbsp;alum’s tweets, Caroline seemingly <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>addressed the issue</a> during an interview on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>New York Live</a> on Mar. 16. “I can’t say much, only because it’s not good for my headspace, but it took a lot for me to go back [to the&nbsp;Housewives universe] there,” she told the host two weeks ago. “[I was] going back with the best of intentions, with the highest of hopes, to do something fun. Unfortunately, it didn’t work out for me that way.” Finally, the 61-year-old admitted that she left the show “early” due to a negative experience. “I came home early,” she added. “And at this point, I just truly don’t have the space in my head to talk about it. So, I’d rather not but I would imagine it would unfold on the series when it airs and there’ll be a lot said then.” Although an official release date for Season 4 has not yet been announced, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Season 3</a> is currently airing on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH10e5JpZpuqkaOxqnnGpZinrpmhuaZ50Z6YnKyjYr%2BpwcatZJyZoqS5qrrEZqSapqqkeqq6wqKbnqakYsG4scStqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
