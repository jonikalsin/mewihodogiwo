Although Maggie’s sunburn looked quite painful, she seemed to be taking it like a champ, and looked relaxed as she held up the peace sign in her pic."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

For the photo, she rocked a teeny tiny black bikini, which showed off how the difference in her natural skin color and the post-burn skin. Several commenters urged Maggie to use soothing aloe on the sunburn, and many others also commented about how great she looked in her swimsuit.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>While Tim and Faith have mostly kept off social media during the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>family getaway</a>, Maggie and her sisters (<strong>Gracie McGraw</strong>, 23, and&nbsp;<strong>Audrey McGraw</strong>, 19) have been <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sharing pics</a> from the trip. Gracie has posted several swimsuit photos, including some of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>herself in the water</a> on Jan. 4. Two days prior, Gracie also shared images of herself posing in the sand while rocking bikini bottoms and a white, crochet cover up.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Faith was pregnant with Gracie when she married Tim in Oct. 1996, and Gracie was born the following May. The country stars were only together romantically for a few months when they tied the knot. In fact, they were both in other relationships when they first met in 1994, but there was simply no denying the spark between them!</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Now, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Tim and Faith</a> have been married for more than 20 years and are one of country music’s hottest and most successful couples. Plus, they have every right to be extremely proud of all three of their daughters — Gracie is a New York University graduate, Maggie graduated from Stanford University and Audrey is a student at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH1ye49vZqaZl5y2pnnMnJ6rmadir6q3yKegZqulo6%2B2vs1mrZqbkam2sLqMn5imoZyuerG0zq2maA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
