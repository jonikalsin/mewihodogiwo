People submit themselves all the time. And I had to do it as a testament to the character and what I feel she represents,” said Christie.</p><p>Although she did not take home the Emmys, her bold move made headlines. In fact, a lot has been talked about her career, but very little has been said about her personal life.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The actress prefers to keep her private life away from the media’s prying eyes, leading fans to wonder,&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Is Gwendoline Christie Married?</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>If you’re wondering whether Christie is married, the answer is no. However, she had been in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">long-term relationship</a> with one of the most sought-after British designers, Giles Deacon, since 2012. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Deacon graduated from London’s prestigious St. Martin's College of Art and Design and has since dressed countless A-listers such as <a href=# rel=follow>Cate Blanchett</a>, Solange Knowles, and Sarah Jessica Parker in his career.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Gwendoline Christie's partner, Giles Deacon in Paris. </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>But the biggest highlight of his career came when he got the opportunity to dress a royal family member.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2017, the designer <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">created</a> a lace wedding gown for Pippa Middleton when she walked down the aisle with hedge fund manager James Matthews.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Deacon has also dressed Christie. He told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Telegraph</a>&nbsp;in 2016 that she was his primary inspiration for his first couture collection. He shared that working with his partner was a pleasure and said she was a “fantastic muse.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Besides being a fantastic muse for his creation, the designer told Grazia UK how he was smitten with his partner.&nbsp;</p><p>“I met Gwendoline six years ago through a mutual friend and was instantly smitten. For a million different reasons, I thought she was extraordinary. The way she carries herself was unlike anything I’d seen before,” the designer told the outlet.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Gwendoline Christie Is Supportive of Her Partner</h2><p>While Deacon loves creating for Christie, the actress loves to wear his creation and is very supportive of her partner.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2015, while speaking about Deacon to InStyle, she said she was wearing his dress from the Spring/Summer 2016 collection, which was going to be shown at London Fashion Week.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>“I truly believe in him as an artist. He’s one of my favorite designers, and he has an exquisite artistic vision with a brilliant and highly developed discipline. That kind of artist is rare, and I think it should be celebrated,” she added.</p><p>The two often work together. For example, when Christie starred as Titania and Hippolyta in a new version of&nbsp;A Midsummer Night’s Dream&nbsp;in London’s Bridge Theater, Deacon designed two dresses for her performance.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She told <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Vogue</a> that “having her strength and Giles’s strength” allowed her to take the space and deliver the story.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJ%2Bnmrulu8uipZ5lk52%2Fqr%2FTopxmpZGnv6qxw2anmqqko7KzesetpKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
